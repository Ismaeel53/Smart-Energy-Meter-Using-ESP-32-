# Smart-Energy-Meter-Using-ESP-32


In this project, we will design our own IoT Based Electricity Energy Meter using ESP32 & monitor data on the Arduino Cloud. 

## Introduction:
With the current technology, you need to go to the meter reading room and take down readings. Thus, monitoring and keeping track records of your electricity consumption is a tedious task. To automate this, we can use the Internet of Things (IOT). The IOT saves time and money by automating remote data collection. Smart Energy Meter has received quite a lot of acclaim across the globe in recent years.

## Components:
- Current Sensor (SCT 013)  
- Voltage Sensor (ZMPT101B)
- ESP-32 microcontroller
- Bulb Holder

## Setting up Arduino :
First of all, we have to create variables in the Arduino cloud. Variables are the containers that will stores the values coming from current sensor and voltage sensor through the ESP 32.
First, we have to write the name and specify the type then a variable will be autogenerated in the Arduino sketch.                
For this project we have to create four variables for different energy parameters like current, voltage, apparent power and energy in kWh.
After this we have to provide the WIFI cradientials so that our EPS 32 can connect to the internet and send data to the cloud.
